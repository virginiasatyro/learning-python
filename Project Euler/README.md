### 1) Multiples of 3 and 5
	If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
	Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### 2) Even Fibonacci numbers
 ```
 Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
 By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### 4) Largest palindrome product
```
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
```

### 5) Smallest multiple
```
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
```

### 6) Sum square difference
```
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

### 7) 10001st prime
```
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
What is the 10 001st prime number?
```

### 9) Special Pythagorean triplet
```
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
a2 + b2 = c2
For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.
There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.

### 16) Power digit sum
```
215 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.
What is the sum of the digits of the number 21000?
```
[Solution](https://github.com/virginiasatyro/Python/blob/master/Project%20Euler/Problems%20Solved/powerDigitSum.py)
### 20) Factorial digit sum
```
n! means n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1
For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800,
and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.
Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!
```

### 25) 1000-digit Fibonacci number
```
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
    Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
Hence the first 12 terms will be:
    F1 = 1
    F2 = 1
    F3 = 2
    F4 = 3
    F5 = 5
    F6 = 8
    F7 = 13
    F8 = 21
    F9 = 34
    F10 = 55
    F11 = 89
    F12 = 144
The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.
What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
```

### 29) Distinct powers
```
Consider all integer combinations of ab for 2 ≤ a ≤ 5 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 5:
    22=4, 23=8, 24=16, 25=32
    32=9, 33=27, 34=81, 35=243
    42=16, 43=64, 44=256, 45=1024
    52=25, 53=125, 54=625, 55=3125
If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:
4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125
How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by ab for 2 ≤ a ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 100?
```

### 34) Digit factorials
```
145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.
Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.
Note: as 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.
